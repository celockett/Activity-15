# Activity 15

This is for submission of Activity 15, which is comprised of quarto file as well as pdf document.
This repository contains my work for Activity 14 in STAT 184.

# Data Sources
1. U.S. Armed Forces Data
   - Public Google Sheet from course materials
   - `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cn4i0-ymB1ZytWXCwsJiq6fZ9PhGLUvbMBHlzqG4bwo/edit?usp=sharing`

The goals of this project are to:
- Practice data wrangling
- Create effective visualizations using ggplot2
- Produce a reproducible report using Quarto combining code, output, and narrative.
- Reflect on what I've learned so far
