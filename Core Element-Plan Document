# Activity 15 – Project & Repo Plan
## 1. Project Plan

### 1.1 Goals
- Goal 1: Data Wrangling
Use R to wrangle and tidy real-world datasets
- Goal 2: Visualization
Create clear visualizations using ggplot2
- Goal 3: Interpretation
Write narrative text explaining what each visualization shows and what conclusions can be drawn from the data
- Goal 4: Reproducibility
Produce a reproducible Quarto document the combines code, results, and narrative, and renders to a PDF document

### 1.2 Needs
- R and RStudio
- Quarto for rendering `.qmd` to PDf
- Github for version control

- `tidyverse`
- `rvest`
- `googlesheets4`
- `janitor`
- `knitr`
- `kableExtra`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `dcData`

- **Data Sources**
 - Public Google Sheet for U.S. Armed Forces data
 - `BabyNames` dataset from the `dcData` package

### 1.3 Steps
1. Set up the Quarto document
2. Wrangle the Armed Forces data
3. Analyze and describe Armed Forces data
4. Wrangle and visualize BabyNames data
5. Define and plot the box volume function
6. Write the "What I've Learned So Far" section
7. Create a code appendix
8.Render and review the PDF document

## 2. Repo Setup

### 2.1 Goals
- Goal 1: Clear Repo Structure
- Goal 2: Version Control and Branching
- Goal 3: Documentation and Issues

### 2.2 Needs
- A Github repository for Activity 15
- `README.md`
- A plan file to document goals, needs, and steps
- Github Issues

### 2.3 Steps
1. Create a new Github repository for Activity 15 and add:
  - .qmd
  - .pdf
  -`README.md`
  -`PLAN .md`
2. Keep `main` as the polished branch
  - Create additional branches as needed
3. Make meaningful changes
4. Use Issues
